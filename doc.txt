(*)output publicPath specifies the virtual directory in web server from where bundled file, app.js is going to get served up from. Keep in mind, the word server when using publicPath can be either webpack-dev-server or express server or other server that you can use with webpack.
(*)add hot module replacement (HMR) to our development environment. HMR exchanges, adds or removes modules while the application is running without requiring a full reload, making our development environment more efficient.
